NFT markets are volatile, and FIFA Collect is no exception. Prices can swing based on a variety of factors. Understanding these can help you make more informed decisions.

### Supply and Demand

The supply of each moment is fixed at minting, but demand fluctuates based on player performance, team popularity, and macro market sentiment. Limited editions or retired players often command higher prices.

### Tournament Hype

Major tournaments like the FIFA World Cup or continental championships generate spikes in interest. Moments featuring players or teams in the spotlight may see temporary price surges as fans buy in. Plan your purchases ahead of these events to avoid buying at peaks.

### New Releases and Airdrops

When FIFA Collect launches new packs or special editions, collectors may sell existing moments to free up funds, causing dips. Conversely, airdropped rewards can introduce supply shocks. Keep an eye on announcements to anticipate these moves.

### Macro Crypto Trends

NFTs are tied to the broader crypto market. Bull markets drive speculative interest, while bear markets can dampen demand. Diversifying across stable assets and only investing what you can afford to lose is crucial.

### Community Sentiment

Engage with community forums and social channels to gauge sentiment. Positive news about platform development, partnerships, or player milestones can catalyse rallies.
