Rarity is a core concept in NFT collecting. It determines how scarce a token is relative to others in the same set, and often drives its value. Here’s what you need to know.

### Scarcity Tiers

Most collections define tiers such as **Common**, **Uncommon**, **Rare**, **Epic**, and **Legendary**. The fewer copies exist, the higher the tier. For example, a Common moment might have 10,000 editions while a Legendary moment could have fewer than 100.

### Grails and Floor

Collectors talk about “grails” — the most coveted items in a collection, often due to historical significance or star players. The “floor” refers to the lowest price available for an item within a set. Watching floor prices helps you identify trends and entry points.

### Serial Numbers

Some platforms (like NBA Top Shot) assign serial numbers to each edition. Collectors may pay a premium for specific serials (e.g. jersey number, #1 mint). FIFA Collect may introduce similar features in future releases.

### Avoiding FOMO

Fear of missing out can lead to impulsive purchases. Avoid buying solely because a drop is hyped. Set a budget, research the player or moment, and consider long‑term value.

### Tools and Resources

Use market analytics tools to track rarity and price movements. Engage with collector communities to learn which moments are considered undervalued.
