Buying your first FIFA Collect NFT might feel complicated, but with the right steps it’s straightforward. This guide walks you through the process from wallet setup to your first purchase.

### 1. Set Up a Wallet

FIFA Collect uses the Avalanche network. You’ll need a crypto wallet like MetaMask or Core Wallet. Install the browser extension and create a new wallet. Make sure to back up your seed phrase securely.

### 2. Bridge USDC to Avalanche

If you have USDC on another chain (e.g. Ethereum), use a bridging service to transfer it to the Avalanche C‑Chain. Services like Synapse or Coinbase’s built‑in bridge make this easy. Remember that you’ll need a small amount of AVAX to pay gas fees.

### 3. Connect Your Wallet to FIFA Collect

Head over to [collect.fifa.com](https://collect.fifa.com) and click “Connect Wallet.” Select your wallet provider and approve the connection in MetaMask. Your wallet address will appear in the top right corner.

### 4. Make Your First Purchase

Browse the marketplace for a moment you like. Click “Buy Now,” confirm the transaction, and wait for it to be processed. Congratulations — you own a piece of football history!

### 5. Stay Safe

Never share your seed phrase. Double check URLs and use official links to avoid phishing. Consider using a hardware wallet for higher‑value assets.
