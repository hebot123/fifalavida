            <p>FIFA Collect is the official digital collectibles platform of world football. Launched initially on the Algorand blockchain and later expanding to Polygon, it allows fans to own affordable digital snippets of football history—from iconic World Cup goals to digital art and membership passes. But beyond mere collecting, the platform has evolved into a functional utility for securing real-world access to the biggest matches on the planet.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-oswald text-emerald-400 mt-12 mb-6">What Can You Collect?</h2>
            <p>The platform operates on a "pack" system similar to traditional sticker collecting, but with verified digital ownership. Key collection types include:</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">🎟️ Right to Buy (RTB)</h3>
                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400">The most valuable assets on the platform. These digital tokens grant the holder the guaranteed right to purchase cash tickets for specific 2026 World Cup matches without entering a lottery.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-oswald text-emerald-400 mt-12 mb-6">The "Right to Buy" (RTB) System</h2>
            <p>For many users, the primary draw of FIFA Collect is the <strong class="text-white">Right to Buy</strong> token. In a tournament where ticket demand outstrips supply by millions, RTBs offer a guaranteed pathway.</p>
            <ul class="space-y-4 my-6 ml-4 border-l border-white/10 pl-4">
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-white block">How to get them:</strong> 
                    RTBs are found in "Glory Drops" (rare, expensive packs), won through completing difficult collection "Challenges," or purchased from other users on the secondary marketplace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-white block">The Conversion Process:</strong> 
                    Holding the token is not enough. You must "burn" or convert the token during specific windows (like the Nov-Dec 2025 window) to secure your seat allocation in the ticketing portal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-white block">Market Value:</strong> 
                    RTBs for high-profile matches (e.g., the Final in New Jersey or the Opener in Mexico City) can trade for thousands of dollars on the marketplace.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-oswald text-emerald-400 mt-12 mb-6">Major 2025 Updates</h2>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-2">1. The Blockchain Migration</h3>
            <div class="bg-emerald-900/20 border border-emerald-500/30 p-4 rounded mb-4 text-sm">
                <strong class="text-emerald-400">Tech Update:</strong> As of mid-2025, FIFA announced a migration from the Algorand blockchain to their own <strong>FIFA Blockchain</strong>, which is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible.
            </div>
            <p>This move is designed to make the platform compatible with popular wallets like MetaMask and improve scalability. Users who held assets on external Algorand wallets (like Pera) were required to bridge their assets back to the platform to ensure a safe transfer to the new chain.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-2">2. FIFA Rewards (Beta)</h3>
            <p>Timed with the Club World Cup 2025, FIFA launched a "FIFA Rewards" program. This gamified loyalty layer allows fans to earn XP for interactions across the FIFA ecosystem (playing games, buying merch, collecting NFTs) to unlock real-world prizes and virtual events with football legends.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-oswald text-emerald-400 mt-12 mb-6">How to Get Started</h2>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3 text-white font-bold">
                <li><span class="text-gray-300 font-normal">Create an Account: Sign up at <a href="https://collect.fifa.com/?referrer=fifalavida" class="text-emerald-400 hover:underline">collect.fifa.com</a>.</span></li>
                <li><span class="text-gray-300 font-normal">Browse the Marketplace: You don't always need to buy packs. The secondary marketplace allows you to snipe specific cards or RTB tokens users are selling.</span></li>
                <li><span class="text-gray-300 font-normal">Complete Challenges: Check the "Challenges" tab. Locking a specific set of cards (e.g., "All French Defenders from 2018") often yields rewards far more valuable than the individual cards themselves.</span></li>
