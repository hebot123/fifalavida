        <p>The 2026 World Cup was sold on the promise of "Regional Clusters." To minimize travel fatigue, FIFA divided the continent into West, Central, and East zones. The logic was simple: teams would stay in their bubble, reducing flight times to under two hours.</p>
        
        <p>But there is one glaring exception to this rule. While the USA and Mexico enjoy cozy, localized schedules, <strong>Canada (Pot 1, Group B)</strong> is undertaking the most brutal travel itinerary of any seeded nation.</p>

        <p>Canada’s decision to split their group stage between Toronto (East) and Vancouver (West) forces them to cross a continent in the middle of the tournament. The question for bettors and fans alike is simple: <strong>Will the jet lag kill their momentum?</strong></p>

        <p>Let’s look at the hard data. While Team USA hops a short flight from Los Angeles to Seattle, Canada must fly from the Atlantic timezone to the Pacific.</p>

        <p>This is not just a long flight; it is a circadian disruption. Traveling West is generally easier than traveling East, but a <strong>3-hour time difference</strong> still requires physiological adjustment.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-oswald text-emerald-400 mt-8 mb-4 border-l-4 border-emerald-500 pl-4">The "Six-Day" Savior</h3>
        <p>If Canada were playing on a standard 3-day rest cycle, this itinerary would be a competitive suicide. However, a closer look at the schedule reveals that FIFA has baked in a massive safety net.</p>

        <div class="bg-white/5 border-l-4 border-emerald-500 p-6 rounded-r my-8">
            <h4 class="text-emerald-400 text-lg font-bold uppercase mb-2">The Recovery Calculation</h4>
            <p class="text-white">Canada plays Match 3 on <strong>June 12</strong> and Match 27 on <strong>June 18</strong>. This provides <strong>5 full rest days</strong> (playing on the 6th day).</p>
        </div>

        <p>Sports science generally suggests it takes <strong>one day of recovery for every timezone crossed</strong>. Canada crosses three time zones but has five days to adjust. Mathematically, the players will be fully acclimated to Pacific Time by kickoff at BC Place.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-oswald text-emerald-400 mt-8 mb-4 border-l-4 border-emerald-500 pl-4">Verdict: Psychological, Not Physical</h3>
        <p>The physical disadvantage is negated by the generous scheduling. The real disadvantage for Canada is logistical.</p>
        
        <p>Most Pot 1 teams will establish a "Base Camp" in one city and bus to their games. Canada effectively has to move their entire operation—medical equipment, staff, and logistics—across the continent mid-tournament. While Team USA relaxes in their California fortress, Canada will be living out of suitcases.</p>
