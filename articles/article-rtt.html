        <p>For fans looking to secure their spot at the 2026 World Cup, the doors to the official channels have temporarily slammed shut. The <strong>Official FIFA Resale Marketplace</strong> is currently in a "freeze," leaving millions of ticket-less fans staring at a "Coming Soon" screen. Whether this is for technical updates or inventory management, the result is the same: you cannot buy or transfer standard tickets right now.</p>
        
        <p>However, there is a backdoor. And unlike the shady third-party sites charging 300% markups, this one is completely official.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-oswald text-emerald-400 mt-8 mb-4 border-l-4 border-emerald-500 pl-4">The Last Open Door: FIFA Collect</h3>
        <p><strong>FIFA Collect</strong> remains the <em>only</em> other marketplace sanctioned by FIFA that is currently open for business. While the main ticket hub is paused, the digital economy on FIFA Collect is thriving.</p>
        
        <p>On this platform, fans buy and sell <strong>"Right to Buy" (RTB)</strong> tokens. These digital assets guarantee you the ability to purchase a cash ticket for a specific match (e.g., Match 4 in Los Angeles) at face value.</p>

        <div class="bg-white/5 border-l-4 border-emerald-500 p-6 rounded-r my-8">
            <h4 class="text-emerald-400 text-lg font-bold uppercase mb-2">The Fee Advantage</h4>
            <p class="text-white mb-2">In a world of hidden service fees, FIFA Collect offers a refreshing structure for the secondary market:</p>
            <ul class="text-sm font-mono text-gray-400 space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Seller Fee:</strong> 15% (taken from the sale price).</li>
                <li><strong>Buyer Fee:</strong> <span class="text-emerald-400 font-bold">0%</span>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-gray-300">If you see a token listed for $200, you pay $200. There is no surprise "processing fee" added at checkout.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-oswald text-emerald-400 mt-8 mb-4 border-l-4 border-emerald-500 pl-4">The Critical Watchout: "Rights" vs. "Tickets"</h3>
        <p>Before you rush to buy, you must understand exactly <em>what</em> you are buying. This platform is designed for genuine fans, not scalpers looking for a quick flip.</p>
        
        <p>When you purchase on FIFA Collect, you are buying a <strong>Right to Ticket</strong> digital token. This token lives in your FIFA Collect wallet.</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li><strong>Trading the Right:</strong> You <em>can</em> buy and sell the digital RTB token freely on the FIFA Collect marketplace (while the window is open).</li>
            <li><strong>The Restriction:</strong> Once you "redeem" that token to buy the actual seat, it becomes a standard mobile ticket in the FIFA Ticketing App. At that point, you are subject to the rules of the main ticketing system—which, as noted, restricts transfers and is currently frozen.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="bg-yellow-900/20 border-l-2 border-yellow-500 p-4 mt-4 text-sm text-gray-300">
            <strong class="text-yellow-500 uppercase text-xs tracking-widest block mb-1">Warning</strong>
            You cannot simply "email" a Right to Ticket token to a friend like a PDF. You must either transfer the token within the FIFA Collect ecosystem (if features allow) or redeem it yourself. This system favors fans who intend to go to the match, rather than brokers.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-oswald text-emerald-400 mt-8 mb-4 border-l-4 border-emerald-500 pl-4">How to Get In</h3>
        <p>The marketplace is active right now. Whether you are hunting for the Opening Match in Mexico City or the Final in New Jersey, the "Right to Buy" tokens are the only secure way to guarantee your seat today.</p>
