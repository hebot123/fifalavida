    <h1 class="article-title">[Guide] FIFA World Cup 2026: Timeline of Ticket Releases & Hold/Sell Strategy</h1>
    
    <p>If you are trying to make sense of the current ticketing chaos, I’ve compiled a timeline of what has actually happened so far and some strategy on how to handle "Right to Ticket" (RTT) tokens or lottery wins moving forward.</p>

    <h2>Part 1: The Timeline of Events (So Far)</h2>
    <p>Here is the breakdown of ticket releases that have already occurred. If you feel like you missed the boat, you aren't alone—a significant chunk of inventory was sold "blind" before we even knew the matchups.</p>

    <div class="timeline-event">
        <span class="timeline-date">September 10 – September 19, 2025</span>
        <strong>Visa Presale Draw (Phase 1)</strong><br>
        <em>What happened:</em> The first opportunity to apply. This was purely a "blind" draw (location/date only, no teams known).<br>
        <em>Inventory Released:</em> ~1 Million tickets sold.
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-event">
        <span class="timeline-date">October 27 – October 31, 2025</span>
        <strong>Early Ticket Draw (Phase 2)</strong><br>
        <em>What happened:</em> A second "blind" draw for early birds.<br>
        <em>Inventory Released:</em> Another ~1 Million tickets sold.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Current Status:</strong> By the time the Match Schedule was revealed in December, roughly <strong>25-30% of the total tournament inventory</strong> (approx. 2 million tickets) had already been sold to fans who were willing to gamble on the teams.
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-event">
        <span class="timeline-date">December 5, 2025</span>
        <strong>The Final Draw</strong><br>
        <em>What happened:</em> The official matchups were revealed. This changed the market instantly. "Blind" tickets suddenly had real value (or lost it) based on which teams landed in which city.
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-event" style="border-left-color: #27ae60; background-color: #eafaf1;">
        <span class="timeline-date" style="color: #27ae60;">December 11, 2025 – January 13, 2026</span>
        <strong>Random Selection Draw OPENS (Phase 3)</strong><br>
        <em>What happened:</em> This is the phase we are in now. It is the <strong>first time</strong> fans can apply for specific matchups (e.g., "I want USA vs. Italy").<br>
        <br>
        <em>Important:</em> This window closes <strong>January 13, 2026</strong>. It is a lottery, not a race. Entering today gives you the same odds as entering on Day 1.
    </div>

    <h2>Part 2: Strategy – What to Hold vs. What to Sell</h2>
    <p>If you are lucky enough to hold "Right to Ticket" tokens (from FIFA Collect) or if you win in the upcoming lottery, here is a general rule of thumb for managing your portfolio.</p>

    <h3>A. Group Stage Matches</h3>

    <div class="strategy-box hold">
        <h4>The "Host/Blue Chip" Strategy (HOLD)</h4>
        <p>If you hold tickets for <strong>USA, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, or Argentina</strong>, do not sell yet.</p>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> Demand will skyrocket in February when the "Unsuccessful" lottery emails go out. Panic buying hasn't started yet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="strategy-box sell">
        <h4>The "Niche/Low Demand" Strategy (SELL NOW)</h4>
        <p>If you hold a token for a match like <strong>Curacao vs. Ivory Coast</strong> or <strong>Panama vs. Gabon</strong> in a massive stadium (65,000+ seats), sell immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> There is a high risk these matches will NOT sell out. If tickets are available for Face Value in the "First-Come, First-Served" phase (Spring 2026), your "Right to Ticket" becomes mathematically worthless. Get your liquidity out now while people are still speculating.</p>
        <p><em>Buyers interested in attending any local game regardless of team, this is your market.</em></p>
    </div>

    <h3>B. Knockout Round Matches</h3>

    <div class="strategy-box hold">
        <h4>Round of 32 / Round of 16 (HOLD)</h4>
        <p><strong>Why:</strong> The value of these tickets is driven by uncertainty. A "Round of 32" ticket in Santa Clara could be USA vs. Norway (worth $2,000) or it could be Paraguay vs. Austria (worth $200).</p>
        <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Hold these until the group stage plays out (June 2026). If a major team looks like they are heading toward your specific bracket slot, the hype will drive the price up 5x–10x before the opponent is even confirmed.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>C. The "Category 1" Trap</h3>
    <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>Be careful holding Category 1 tokens for low-demand games.</strong>
        <p>The Face Value of Cat 1 is high ($350+). Casual fans won't pay a premium on top of that for teams they don't know. Cat 1 is arguably the <strong>riskiest</strong> asset class for small games because you are priced out of the "cheap seat" market. High risk, high reward.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Part 3: Critical Upcoming Dates to Watch</h2>
    <p>Mark these on your calendar. Missing a deadline here could cost you your tickets.</p>

    <ul class="date-list">
        <li>
            <span class="date-highlight">January 13, 2026</span>
            <strong>Lottery Application Window Closes.</strong><br>
            Last chance to apply for tickets at face value via the random draw.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="date-highlight">February 2026</span>
            <strong>Lottery Results Announced.</strong><br>
            Winners are charged; losers are notified. Expect resale prices to spike immediately after this date as "FOMO" sets in for the unlucky fans.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="date-highlight">Spring 2026 (March/April)</span>
            <strong>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Phase.</strong><br>
            The "General Sale." Any unsold tickets are released in real-time. This is usually chaos (virtual waiting rooms, site crashes).<br>
            <em>Also: The Official FIFA Resale Platform typically launches around this time for fans to resell tickets at face value.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="date-highlight">May/June 2026</span>
            <strong>RTT Conversion Window (Crucial for Token Holders).</strong><br>
            If you hold "Right to Ticket" on FIFA Collect, you must manually log in and "burn" (convert) them into real mobile tickets during this window. If you forget, the token expires and you lose the seat.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="date-highlight">Early June 2026</span>
            <strong>Ticket Transfers Open.</strong><br>
            This is when you can finally send tickets to your friends/family via the FIFA Ticketing App.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tldr">
        <h3>TL;DR Summary</h3>
        <p>The easy money was made in the "Blind" phases. Now we are in the "Specific" phase. Sell the low-demand games before the general public realizes they can buy them for retail price in the Spring. Hold the big teams until the February panic sets in.</p>
