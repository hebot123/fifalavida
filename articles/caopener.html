            On June 12, 2026, Canada’s Men’s National Team will walk out at Toronto Stadium (BMO Field) for the country’s
            first-ever men’s FIFA World Cup™ match on home soil. It’s not just a group-stage game – it’s a historic moment
            for Canadian football, set on the Lake Ontario waterfront in one of the world’s most diverse cities.

                Why Traveling for Canada’s Opener Is Different From a Regular Trip to Toronto
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Most Toronto guides assume you’re here for Niagara Falls, a concert, or a weekend city break. A World Cup
                opener adds an extra layer: newly expanded stadium seating, major security operations along the waterfront,
                and thousands of visiting fans compressed into a relatively tight area around Exhibition Place.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Three realities World Cup fans should plan around:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">Upgraded but evolving stadium:</span>
                    BMO Field is being expanded with temporary seating and infrastructure specifically for the World Cup.
                    That means some maps, entrances, and photos online will be out of date by 2026.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">Waterfront bottlenecks:</span>
                    Exhibition Place sits between Lake Ontario and rail lines/major roads. On match days, some usual
                    car routes and parking options will be restricted, making transit and walking paths more important.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">“Everywhere” is multi-cultural:</span>
                    Toronto isn’t just diverse in a few neighborhoods. You’ll hear multiple languages at every café,
                    on every streetcar, and definitely in the stands – embrace that as part of the experience.

                1. When to arrive and how long to stay
            </h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">Arrive 2–3 days before June 12</span> if you’re crossing several time zones.
                    It gives you time to adjust, explore the city, and handle any travel hiccups long before kickoff.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine the opener with <span class="font-semibold text-white">Canada’s later group matches in Vancouver</span>
                    if you’re planning a longer trip – Toronto to Vancouver flights are frequent, but prices will spike around match days.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoid planning your departure the <em>night</em> of the match. Late kickoffs, celebrations, and transit congestion
                    make same-night flights a gamble.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-2">
                2. Entry rules: visas, eTAs, and border timing
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Canada’s entry process is straightforward if you prepare early, but it’s not something to handle at the last minute.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>
                    Many travelers need an <span class="font-semibold text-white">eTA (Electronic Travel Authorization)</span>
                    when flying into Canada – it’s quick online, but must be approved before you board.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Others require a full visitor visa. Start that process months in advance and bring proof of accommodation,
                    tickets, and return flights.

                    best option for most fans, especially those continuing to Vancouver or U.S. host cities.

                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (YTZ)</span> is on an island

            <p class="mb-4">
                Toronto is compact enough to navigate, but big enough that a “random downtown hotel” can still mean long
                match-day travel. Choose your base with intention: proximity to the stadium, transit access, and the kind
                of nightlife or calm you prefer.

                    This area hugs the stadium and waterfront. You’ll trade some “tourist sights” for the ability to walk

                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">GO Train to Exhibition Station:</span>
                    From Union Station, GO trains (Lakeshore lines) can drop you right at Exhibition – a short walk to the stadium.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">Streetcars (TTC):</span>
                    Routes along Queen’s Quay and King/Queen will have stops near Exhibition. Expect special event schedules
                    and crowding – but they’re still often faster than driving.

                    UP Express to Union Station, then GO or streetcar to Exhibition is a clean, airport-to-stadium path.

                <li>
                    Staying in Liberty Village, King West, or parts of downtown? A <span class="font-semibold text-white">20–35 minute walk</span>
                    along the waterfront or side streets can be more predictable than any vehicle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Toronto’s bike-share system and separated bike paths along the waterfront can be useful – just remember
                    you’ll be sharing space with lots of other fans.

            </h3>

                <li>
                    Parking at Exhibition Place is limited and likely to be heavily pre-booked. Don’t assume you can just
                    “show up and find a spot”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If using Uber/Lyft, set your drop-off a few blocks away from the tightest traffic zone and walk the last stretch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the match, walk 10–15 minutes away from the main exits before requesting a ride to escape the
                    biggest traffic jams.
                </li>
            </ul>

                Whatever your method, aim to be <span class="font-semibold text-white">through security 90–120 minutes before kick-off</span>.
                This is Canada’s home opener – security, ceremonies, and crowds will all be dialed up.

                Inside Toronto Stadium: Details Most Guides Skip

                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">Lake breeze factor:</span>
                    Being right on the waterfront means conditions can shift quickly – warm in the sun, cool and breezy once
                    the wind picks up or the sun goes down. Bring a light layer even if the forecast looks mild.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">Temporary seating & new layouts:</span>
                    With added capacity, your section might be in a newly built stand. Follow match-day signage rather than
                    relying on older fan photos or blogs.

                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">Food game plan:</span>
                    Toronto Stadium has upgraded food options and local vendors, but lines will spike pre-match and at halftime.
                    Eat a small meal before arriving, then top up early once you’re inside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">Noise and atmosphere:</span>
                    A historic first match means extra emotion – drums, chants, and national anthems will be loud.
                    Ear protection is helpful for kids or noise-sensitive fans.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold text-white">Meeting points:</span>
                    Pick a specific landmark (gate number, statue, or fan zone sign) as your “if we get separated” spot
                    <em>outside</em> the stadium, where mobile signals may work better.

                Final Whistle: Turning a Historic Match into a Seamless Trip
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Canada’s opening match in Toronto is more than a fixture list entry – it’s a milestone for the sport in the country
                and a once-in-a-generation moment for fans. With smart planning, you can enjoy the atmosphere on the waterfront,
                get in and out of the stadium smoothly, and still have time to experience the best of the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choose the neighborhood that matches your style, pad your schedule around June 12 with healthy buffers, respect the
                communities hosting the tournament, and let Toronto’s culture, food, and lakefront energy fill the spaces between
                kickoff and final whistle. Do that, and your memory of Canada’s first home World Cup match won’t just be about the
                scoreline – it’ll be about an entire trip that felt organized, exciting, and unforgettable.
